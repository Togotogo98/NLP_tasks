# NLP Tasks
Propaganda dataset includes 2 files with identical format: one for training and one for testing. Each file is in tab-separated-value (tsv) format with 2 columns as 'Label' and 'Sentence'.

# Tasks are as follows:
## Task 1. 
Build and evaluate at least 2 approaches to classify whether a sentence contains propaganda or
 not.
 ## Task 2. 
 Given a snippet or span of text which is known to contain propaganda, build and evaluate at least
 2 approaches to classifying the propaganda technique which has been used.
